<h2>ðŸŒŸ We can't make it alone ðŸŒŸ<h2></h2>

Puzzle game 2D, made in Unity first, and currently working on Godot 4.2.

_"This story is about resilience, about our ability to adapt to adversity, to tragedy, and emerge with our strength of will and positivity. 
Alice never believed she possessed this gift, always hidden in her own reality, where it wasn't necessary to define every sense, situation, or state. 
But when her reality was completely altered, she had to adapt. First, survive, then, fight, and finally, be resilient."_


New project I'm working on it, for now it's only a paper prototype, but I'm too excited about what is to come ðŸ˜˜ðŸ§¡

### In the meantime, meet Alice ðŸ‘‡
